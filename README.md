(a) Using both the impulse invariance method and the bilinear transformation
method, design two digital Chebyshev Type I LPFs with the same
specification below for the digital filters.  
 Passband edge at 0.3π rad/sec  
 Stopband edge at 0.4π rad/sec  
 Maximum passband attenuation of 0.2 dB  
 Minimum stopband attenuation of 20 dB  
At first, design the analog prototype filters using MATLAB. Then, transform
the analog filter system functions to the desired digital filter system
functions using MATLAB. Plot the magnitude responses both in dB and
linear scale, the group delay responses, and the pole-zero locations using
MATLAB. Show all steps used in the design. And, compare and discuss the
results.
(b) Using the windowing method, design linear-phase FIR LPFs with the above
specification.
Use each of the following windows for the design: Rectangular and
Hamming. Plot the impulse response coefficients, the magnitude responses
both in dB and linear scale, the group delay responses, and the pole-zero
locations of the designed filters. Discuss your results, by comparison with
the results obtained in (a).
